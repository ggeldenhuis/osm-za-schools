* Determine isced values for schools in South Africa
** Update wiki: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:isced:level

* Determine fields we want. We don't want it all. Interested parties should be able to use a key value and map it with external data. 

* Devise way of tracking progress, which schools have been mapped?

* Import raw data

* Filter out data that will not be used. Map filters for future use.
Data to use:
NatEmis
Institution_Name

* Document process on wiki as we go along or when we finished. It needs to be repeatable by anyone else

* Devise update process as part of documentation.
